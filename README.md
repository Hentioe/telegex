# Telegex

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/telegex.svg)](http://hex.pm/packages/telegex)

This library is a client implementation of the official bot API, without any encapsulation. Original flavor!

The models and APIs of this library are all constructed by DSL (well-designed macros) and contain complete typespecs.

## Do not use üòù

It currently lacks testing and is not complete. Please wait for the release of version 0.1!
